description: Create, edit, review, and improve AGENTS.md files for repositories used by agentic coding tools with concise, actionable instructions and correct precedence behavior. Use whenever AGENTS.md content is being changed, including updating existing guidance, drafting a new AGENTS.md, migrating legacy instruction files, defining nested overrides in monorepos, or debugging why tools load the wrong guidance.

# AGENTS.md Writer

Edit AGENTS.md guidance to be short, specific, and executable. Prefer repository facts over generic advice.
Default to editing existing instruction files; create new files only when no suitable file exists for the scope.

## Workflow

1. Identify target tools and audit instruction sources.
- Detect which agentic tools must read the file (for example Codex, OpenCode, Claude Code, Cursor).
- Inspect repo-root and nested instruction files already in use (`AGENTS.md` and tool-specific alternatives).
- Read the matching tool docs for discovery/precedence behavior before editing.
- Read [references/openai-codex-agents-md.md](references/openai-codex-agents-md.md) only when Codex behavior matters.

2. Prefer edit-in-place over scaffolding.
- Start from the closest existing instruction file and keep diffs minimal.
- Create a new file only when guidance is missing for a scope or precedence must change.

3. Collect project facts before writing.
- Read package manager scripts, CI workflows, linters/formatters, and test commands.
- Extract only commands and constraints that are true in the current repository.
- Add instructions only for recurring failures agents cannot resolve reliably from code discovery.

4. Draft the smallest useful change.
- Include only instructions an agent cannot infer quickly from code.
- Use imperative bullets with concrete commands and paths.
- Cover setup/build/test, code conventions, testing expectations, safety constraints, and change-management rules.
- Prefer positive direction over broad prohibitions when possible.
- If a behavior can be fixed in codebase structure/tooling, prefer that over adding instruction text.

5. Place overrides intentionally.
- Put shared defaults at repo root.
- Put subproject-specific guidance near the subtree it governs.
- Use `AGENTS.override.md` only when replacing same-directory `AGENTS.md` is intentional.
- Keep cross-tool guidance in common files; isolate tool-specific quirks to clearly labeled sections.

6. Verify and tighten.
- Remove duplicates from README or docs unless needed for execution.
- Remove vague guidance.
- Ensure each rule is observable, testable, or clearly enforceable.
- Validate behavior from repo root and a nested subdirectory with each target tool when possible.
- Remove architecture summaries and generated context that tools can infer from source in seconds.

## Authoring Rules

- Prefer exact commands over abstract advice.
- Encode hard constraints: security boundaries, data policies, migration safeguards, approval gates.
- Keep architecture prose brief; link docs by path instead.
- Keep instructions concise to avoid truncation by byte limits.
- Resolve conflicts explicitly so nearest-file precedence is unambiguous.
- Keep guidance tool-agnostic unless a rule is truly tool-specific.
- Treat instruction text as a patch for repeated failures, not a full project explainer.
- Avoid "pink elephant" phrasing (for example broad "do not use X") unless required for safety/compliance.

## Recommended Skeleton

```md
# AGENTS.md

## Setup commands
- Install deps: `...`
- Start dev env: `...`

## Build and test
- Full checks: `...`
- Fast checks for touched package: `...`

## Code conventions
- Formatter/linter commands: `...`
- Framework or language constraints: `...`

## Change expectations
- Add or update tests for changed behavior.
- Update docs in `...` when public APIs change.

## Safety and approvals
- Do not ...
- Ask before ...

## Tool-specific notes (optional)
- Codex: ...
- OpenCode: ...
```

## Debug Discovery

- Use each target tool's introspection or dry-run command to report active instruction files.
- Compare behavior from repo root and a nested subdirectory to confirm precedence.
- If source attribution is unclear, inspect tool logs/session traces when available.
- If instructions are missing, verify filename support, precedence rules, non-empty files, size limits, and restart requirements.
