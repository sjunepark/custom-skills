description: Teach a code or document change set in clear learning order, with embedded snippets, before/after contrasts, and clear implications. Use whenever the user wants help understanding a `git diff`, unstaged changes, a commit, commit range, PR patch, or two versions of a file or document, especially when they want a guided walkthrough that starts with the big picture and then explains why and how the patch works. Prefer this skill when the user wants snippets instead of file or line references, even if they only ask "walk me through this diff" or "help me understand these changes."

# Change Explainer

Teach the change, not just the patch mechanics.

The goal is to help the user understand:
- what problem or purpose the change seems to address
- what changed at a high level
- how the important edits fit together
- how control flow, data flow, or contracts changed
- what implications matter for readers, callers, or future changes

This is primarily an explanatory skill. Do not turn it into a code review by default. Offer opinions only when the change appears to introduce a material issue or an important tradeoff the user should know about.

## First-Class Inputs

Handle these as normal entry points:
- `git diff`
- unstaged or staged local changes
- a commit
- a commit range
- a PR patch or review diff
- two versions of a file or document

If the user provides another concrete comparison format, adapt the same workflow.

## Core Behavior

1. Start from the reader's question.
- Identify what the user is trying to understand about the change, not just which files moved.
- Match the depth to the request.
- If the user asks broadly, narrow to the smallest useful mental model first.

2. Build a mental model before hunk details.
- Begin with the patch's purpose, scope, or visible behavior change.
- Then explain the main implementation flow.
- Then cover supporting edits such as helpers, tests, docs, or cleanup.
- Avoid starting with file-by-file or hunk-by-hunk narration unless the user explicitly wants that.

3. Anchor on the actual change.
- Read the diff first.
- Then read surrounding code, tests, and nearby docs only where needed to explain intent, ownership, or invariants.
- Do not speculate about the design before checking the code around the changed hunk.

4. Reorder the explanation for comprehension.
- Do not explain hunks in raw diff order unless the diff is already easy to follow.
- Group related edits into a small number of conceptual changes.
- Prefer an order like:
  - what this patch is trying to accomplish
  - user-visible behavior
  - interface or contract changes
  - main control-flow or state changes
  - data model or persistence changes
  - tests and docs

5. Teach relationships, not isolated hunks.
- Explain how edits connect across files.
- Show who calls what, where decisions moved, and how data or state now flows differently.
- If responsibilities were split, merged, or renamed, make that relationship explicit.

6. Use snippets as the primary evidence.
- Embed short, focused code snippets directly in the response.
- Start each snippet with a comment that names the file path it came from.
- Prefer the smallest snippet that makes the point clear.
- Use multiple small snippets instead of one large dump when several ideas matter.
- Show `before` and `after` snippets when the contrast helps.
- Do not send the user to file paths or line numbers unless they explicitly ask for references.

7. Use ASCII diagrams when flow is easier to see than describe.
- Add a compact ASCII diagram when it materially improves understanding of:
  - control flow across changed components
  - data flow before vs after
  - ownership or boundary changes
  - state transitions affected by the patch
- Keep diagrams compact, readable, and ASCII-only.
- Do not add a diagram if prose and snippets already make the point clear.

8. Separate explanation from judgment.
- Stay mainly descriptive.
- Add judgment only for issues that look important enough to change how the user should read the patch:
  - correctness risk
  - behavior regression risk
  - broken contract or compatibility risk
  - meaningful security or data-handling concern
  - a design tradeoff that materially affects future work
- If there is no important concern, say so plainly and keep the focus on understanding.

## Workflow

1. Identify the comparison unit.
- Confirm whether you are explaining local changes, a specific commit, a commit range, a PR patch, or a file-to-file comparison.
- If the comparison is ambiguous, infer the most likely source from the task and available context.

2. Read the change before the surroundings.
- Start with the diff or patch.
- Pull in neighboring code only where the diff alone does not explain behavior, ownership, or invariants.

3. Build conceptual buckets.
- Merge scattered hunks that serve one idea.
- Split one large diff into separate conceptual changes when it mixes different concerns.
- Name each bucket by its purpose, not by the file it touched.

4. Organize the explanation as a lesson.
- Start with the highest-level purpose of the patch.
- Then move through the main behavior or contract changes.
- Then explain the supporting implementation details that make those changes work.
- Keep tests and docs near the concept they validate rather than treating them as a disconnected appendix.

5. Teach with evidence.
- For each conceptual change, include a small snippet, before/after contrast, pseudocode summary, or compact ASCII diagram when appropriate.
- Explain why the snippet matters.
- Connect the evidence back to the larger mental model of the patch.

6. Close with implications.
- Mention what the change means for callers, operators, maintainers, or future edits.
- Label inferences as inferences when they are not directly stated in the code or tests.

7. Add warnings only when warranted.
- If a critical or important issue stands out, include it in a compact note.
- Do not pad the answer with minor style opinions or speculative nitpicks.

## Snippet Rules

- Use fenced code blocks for snippets.
- Put the source file path in the first line of the snippet as a comment.
- Match the comment style to the language when practical, for example `// src/auth/session.ts` or `# app/models/user.rb`.
- If the language is unclear, use a neutral comment style or label the snippet in surrounding prose.
- Keep each snippet narrowly scoped to the point being explained.
- Prefer the changed lines plus just enough surrounding context to make them legible.
- If a long function changed, excerpt the relevant branch, condition, signature, or data shape instead of pasting the whole function.
- When comparing versions, make the contrast obvious:

```ts
// src/auth/session.ts
// before
if (!session) return null;

// after
if (!session || session.expiresAt < now) return null;
```

- If the exact old code is unavailable, show the current code and explain the inferred delta without pretending to quote the previous version.

## Diagram Rules

- Use diagrams only when they make the patch easier to understand.
- Use compact ASCII diagrams that render clearly in plain Markdown.
- Do not use Mermaid.
- Keep them small and purpose-built for one idea.
- Favor these diagram types:
  - before/after flow
  - module relationship map
  - state transition sketch
  - data transformation pipeline
- Put the diagram near the explanation it supports.
- Explain the diagram briefly instead of assuming it is self-explanatory.

Example:

```text
Before: Route -> Repo
After:  Route -> Service -> Repo
```

This works when the important change is a new ownership boundary rather than a line-by-line code delta.

## Output Shape

Use this shape unless the user asks for something else:

### Big Picture
- One short paragraph on what this patch is trying to do and where it matters.

### How the Change Works
- Explain each conceptual change in logical learning order.
- Use embedded snippets as evidence.
- Add a compact ASCII diagram if it makes the flow or relationships clearer.
- Focus on behavior, boundaries, and movement of control or data.

### Key Ideas
- Call out the few abstractions, invariants, contracts, or design decisions that make the patch make sense.

### Important Implications
- List only the consequences that materially affect usage, behavior, compatibility, testing, or maintenance.

### Important Concerns
- Include only if there is a critical or important issue.
- If there is no such issue, omit this section or say there are no material concerns.

## Communication Rules

- Optimize for learning, not exhaustiveness.
- Prefer a coherent lesson over a file-by-file or hunk-by-hunk tour.
- Do not default to flat bullet lists like "change 1, change 2, change 3" unless the user explicitly wants a recap.
- Do not default to review language like "finding" or "severity" unless the user explicitly wants review mode.
- Do not mention file names or line numbers as the primary navigation aid.
- Keep the explanation concrete enough that the user does not need to open an editor just to follow the answer.
- When inferring intent or tradeoffs, say that you are inferring from the change.
- If the user seems to want a concise overview, stay high-level.
- If the user clearly wants deeper teaching, go further into mechanisms and tradeoffs.

## Example Triggers

- "Walk me through my unstaged changes and explain them in an order that makes sense."
- "Explain this diff like I'm joining the review late. Start with the big picture, then show me how the patch works."
- "I don't want a file-by-file recap. Teach me this commit with snippets."
- "Compare these two versions and explain the implementation change in the easiest order to learn."
- "Help me understand what changed, why, and what it implies. Show snippets, not file references."
