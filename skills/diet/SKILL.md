description: Review code for unearned weight and overengineering. Use whenever the user asks whether code is overbuilt, helper-heavy, schema-heavy, field-heavy, wrapper-heavy, or bandaged on; wants to know what can be deleted, collapsed, inlined, or questioned; mentions too many helpers, abstractions, JSON fields, DB columns, DTO properties, config options, or future-proofing; says a change feels appended instead of integrated; or asks to "put this on a diet," "trim the fat," or "make this leaner." Focus on review and diagnosis first, not automatic refactor planning.

# Diet

Review code for **unearned weight**.

The core question is:

> What in this code does not earn its maintenance cost today?

This skill is not a general architecture or folder-layout review. It is a simplification review for code that feels heavier than the problem requires: too many helpers, wrappers, schema fields, columns, options, generic layers, or appended paths that solve the task by adding more machinery instead of integrating with the existing design.

Do not assume code came from an LLM or agent. Judge the code on its merits. If the user mentions vibe-coded or agent-written changes, treat that only as context for the review lens, not as evidence.

Do not force deletions. Explicit, readable, well-bounded code is often worth keeping even when it is not minimal.

## Scope

Use this skill when the user's main concern is excess code weight, speculative flexibility, or bolted-on design.

Prefer this skill over broader design or structure review when the user asks things like:
- is this overengineered?
- what can we remove?
- do we need these helpers / wrappers / fields / columns?
- this patch feels bandaged on; what is the real issue?
- can you trim this down without losing clarity?

Do **not** drift into folder, directory, or module reorganization unless that is central to the weight problem or the user explicitly asked for it.

## Review Posture

Treat these principles as guides, not dogma:
- **YAGNI**: do not keep machinery only for hypothetical future cases.
- **AHA / rule of three**: avoid hasty abstractions; duplicate twice before extracting the wrong shared layer.
- **Duplication can be cheaper than the wrong abstraction** when a shared helper now needs flags, modes, or branching to serve diverging cases.
- **Prefer integration over appending**: solve the problem in the existing design when possible instead of adding side channels, one-off adapters, or parallel flows.
- **Keep readability-oriented explicitness**: a small helper, wrapper, or object can be worth its cost when it clarifies naming, boundaries, or invariants.

## Workflow

1. Anchor the review in the real code.
- Read the changed files, nearby interfaces, and affected tests or docs when relevant.
- Distinguish between:
  - code that is truly serving current behavior
  - code that mainly exists for hypothetical future flexibility
  - code that was appended as a workaround instead of integrated cleanly

2. Ask what each extra piece buys **now**.
- For every helper, wrapper, field, column, option, mode, schema entry, or abstraction layer, ask:
  - what current behavior depends on this?
  - what concrete maintenance cost does it remove?
  - would the code be clearer if this were inlined, deleted, or made more specific?

3. Look for weight-gain patterns.
- Extra JSON fields, DTO properties, DB columns, or config keys that current behavior barely uses.
- Helpers or wrappers that mostly forward calls or rename things without improving boundaries, reuse, or invariants.
- Shared helpers that now need booleans, enums, "mode" parameters, or branching to cover multiple cases.
- Generic abstractions with only one real path.
- Translation or mapping layers added mainly to preserve genericity.
- Extension points, hooks, strategy objects, or configuration surfaces with no concrete second use.
- Appended code paths, special cases, or side channels that solve one feature without cleaning up the underlying seam.
- Data models shaped for imagined futures rather than today's behavior.

4. Keep the bar high.
- Do not call something waste just because it is abstract.
- Do not punish code for being explicit.
- Do not recommend broad redesign when a narrow simplification is enough.
- Do not manufacture findings. A valid conclusion is that the code is already lean enough.

## Review Standard

Treat these as strong signals that code may deserve a diet:
- A field, column, option, or hook exists mostly for future flexibility, and current behavior barely touches it.
- A helper, wrapper, or abstraction adds another jump without improving naming, ownership, invariants, or real reuse.
- Callers still need to know internal details the abstraction claimed to hide.
- A supposedly shared helper now branches by flag, type, mode, or conditionals to serve diverging cases.
- One concept requires repeated mapping or translation layers mostly to preserve a generic design.
- The fix was appended alongside the existing design instead of integrated into it, and that workaround is likely to spread.
- The code became harder to follow because it optimized for hypothetical later work instead of today's path.

Treat these as weak signals that often do **not** justify action by themselves:
- The code is a little repetitive but still clear.
- A helper is single-use but materially improves the call site or name.
- A wrapper isolates an awkward dependency or side effect behind a better seam.
- A small object groups related data in a way that makes invariants easier to see.
- The code is explicit rather than clever.
- A bit of duplication is cheaper than a shared abstraction.

## Output

Use this structure when reporting:

### Bucket I — Obvious / High-Confidence
- Put findings here when there is a likely simplification path that does not need much discussion.
- Keep this concise.
- For each item, include:
  - what seems overweight
  - why it does not appear to earn its cost today
  - the smallest reasonable simplification direction
  - the main tradeoff only if it matters

### Bucket II — Worth Discussing
- Put findings here when there are real tradeoffs, unclear constraints, or multiple plausible directions.
- For each item, include:
  - what seems overweight or bandaged on
  - what decision or missing constraint makes it uncertain
  - the main options and tradeoffs

### Keep As-Is
- Call out choices that may look heavy at first glance but are paying for themselves now.
- Say plainly when explicitness, duplication, or a small abstraction is the right choice.

### Verdict
- End with one of:
  - `Lean enough as-is`
  - `Recommended targeted simplifications`
  - `Recommended changes include design decisions`
  - `Broader redesign may be warranted after clarifying constraints`
- If Bucket I or Bucket II is empty, say so explicitly.

## Snippet Rules

- Prefer small embedded snippets over editor-style line references when code evidence matters.
- Put the source file path on the first line of each snippet as a comment.
- Keep snippets tight: helper signatures, schema shapes, wrapper layers, flags, mode switches, and appended branches are usually enough.

## Communication Rules

- Be direct and specific.
- Default to the smallest useful recommendation.
- Prioritize real maintenance cost over aesthetic minimalism.
- Preserve code that is explicit, readable, and earning its keep.
- If the best answer is to leave the code alone, say so plainly.
- If a concern is plausible but weakly supported, put it in Bucket II or Keep As-Is rather than overstating confidence.

## Example Triggers

- "Is this overengineered?"
- "Can you put this code on a diet?"
- "What can we delete without losing clarity?"
- "Do we actually need these helpers and wrappers?"
- "This schema feels too big for what the feature does."
- "Review this diff for bandage code or speculative flexibility."
- "Did we add too many fields / columns / config options here?"
- "This works, but it feels heavier than it should be."
