description: Create or update repo learning material under `docs/learning` for readers who are new to the codebase but already know programming. Treat that material as onboarding guidance, not the project's source of truth for implementation behavior or decisions. Use only when the user explicitly asks for learning material, onboarding docs, a codebase guide, a repo handbook, or `docs/learning` content. Default to the whole repository unless the user scopes the request more narrowly.

# Learning Material Writer

Write concise learning material that helps a programmer become fluent in an unfamiliar repository. Use the same teaching priorities as `teach`: build the mental model first, explain roles and boundaries before low-level details, use small snippets only when they genuinely clarify the point, and add compact ASCII diagrams only when they reduce explanation.

The difference is output shape: instead of replying with one lesson in chat, create a navigable document set inside `docs/learning`.

Learning material is for orientation and onboarding. It must not present itself as the repository's authoritative source for implementation truth, product decisions, or development policy.

## Defaults

- Default scope to the whole repository.
- Respect any user-provided focus areas, audiences, exclusions, or terminology.
- Assume the reader is new to this repo, but not new to programming.
- Write fast-reading docs: concise, concrete, and skimmable.
- Prefer stable design explanation over implementation trivia.
- Treat learning docs as secondary guidance that points readers toward more authoritative sources when needed.

## Documentation Status

- Make it explicit that `docs/learning` is for onboarding and reader understanding.
- Do not frame learning docs as the source of truth for implementation behavior, decision-making, or project policy.
- In `docs/learning/INDEX.md`, include a short note telling readers to defer to more authoritative sources when accuracy or current behavior matters.
- If the repository already has a suitable project-level surface such as `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, or another docs index, update that surface when needed so the role of `docs/learning` is obvious there too.
- Prefer short notes in existing index, documentation-role, or contribution sections over adding a large new policy block.
- Do not create a brand-new top-level file just to carry this note unless the user asked for that.
- Point readers to the best available canonical sources for the repo, such as source code, tests, architecture docs, ADRs, API contracts, or product requirements.

## Workflow

1. Establish scope and current state.
- Read the repo root, nearby docs, and existing `docs/learning` if present.
- If the user did not narrow the task, cover the whole repo.
- Identify the main entry points, top-level directories, major modules, important flows, and architecture seams.

2. Build a teaching map before writing files.
- Decide what a new reader must understand first, second, and later.
- Group material by learning need, not by mirroring the source tree blindly.
- Prefer a small number of strong topics over a sprawling document dump.
- Make the planned folder names and file names read like a table of contents.

3. Create a clear hierarchy under `docs/learning`.
- Use `docs/learning/INDEX.md` as the root entry point.
- Use unnumbered, descriptive directories and filenames.
- Add `INDEX.md` inside directories that contain multiple child pages.
- Keep hierarchy shallow unless the codebase genuinely needs more depth.
- Cross-link parent, child, and related pages so readers can move through the material intentionally.

4. Teach in learning order.
- Start with what the system is for and how the major pieces fit together.
- Then explain runtime flows, module responsibilities, boundaries, and design decisions.
- Then cover deeper subsystem pages only where the repo has enough complexity to justify them.
- Reuse the `teach` style: purpose first, then main flow, then key mechanisms, then confusing parts.

5. Keep docs durable and readable.
- Prefer responsibilities, relationships, invariants, and tradeoffs.
- Avoid file-by-file catalogs unless a code map page specifically needs them.
- Avoid line-by-line walkthroughs.
- Avoid copying large source snippets into docs.
- If a rationale is inferred rather than explicit, label it as an inference.

## Required Coverage

The document set should normally cover these areas, adapted to the repo:

- big-picture system purpose and shape
- codebase structure and major directories
- major modules or subsystems and each one's responsibility
- how modules interact with each other
- important runtime or data flows
- boundary lines: ownership, APIs, persistence, external integrations, layering, or other seams
- key design decisions, tradeoffs, and constraints that help the structure make sense
- confusing or non-obvious areas that a newcomer should notice early

If some area does not meaningfully exist in the repo, omit it rather than forcing a template.

## Topology Rules

Treat the docs like a short book, not a dump of notes.

- The directory tree should read like a TOC.
- Folder names should describe topics, not internal chores.
- Put overview pages above detail pages.
- Split into subdirectories only when a topic has multiple natural child pages.
- Prefer topic groupings such as `system-overview`, `runtime-flows`, `module-boundaries`, `subsystems`, or `design-decisions` when they fit the repo.
- Do not force those exact names if the repo suggests clearer ones.

Good patterns:

```text
docs/learning/
  INDEX.md
  system-overview.md
  codebase-map.md
  runtime-flows/
    INDEX.md
    request-lifecycle.md
    background-jobs.md
  subsystems/
    INDEX.md
    auth.md
    billing.md
  design-decisions/
    INDEX.md
    state-management.md
```

```text
docs/learning/
  INDEX.md
  product-and-architecture.md
  how-data-moves/
    INDEX.md
    ingestion.md
    serving.md
  major-parts/
    INDEX.md
    api-layer.md
    storage-layer.md
```

Bad patterns:

- one page per source file
- directory names that only mirror `src/` without explaining why those parts matter
- deep nesting with thin content
- piles of isolated notes with no index page or reading path

## Writing Rules

- Optimize for fast understanding.
- Prefer short sections, flat bullets, and direct prose.
- Explain why a module exists before describing how it works.
- Name who owns what and where decisions happen.
- Explain interfaces and seams in plain language.
- Use snippets sparingly and only when a small example makes a boundary or flow easier to grasp.
- Use ASCII diagrams only when they shorten the explanation; do not use Mermaid.
- Keep tone instructional, calm, and matter-of-fact.
- Do not add exercises, quizzes, or checkpoints.
- Do not pad pages with generic onboarding advice.

## Page Design

Use a page shape that helps scanning. Adapt section names as needed, but most pages should answer some of these quickly:

- what this part is for
- where it sits in the system
- what it talks to
- what it owns
- what assumptions or invariants matter
- what design tradeoffs or confusing edges are worth knowing

Good page openings:
- one short paragraph that orients the reader
- a compact bullet list of responsibilities or relationships
- a tiny diagram if that is the shortest way to show structure

## Root Index Expectations

`docs/learning/INDEX.md` should usually include:

- what this learning set is for
- a short note that it is onboarding material, not the authoritative source of truth for implementation or decisions
- the recommended reading path
- a short map of the major topic pages and directories
- one-line descriptions for each linked page

Directory `INDEX.md` pages should do the same thing for their local section.

## Editing Existing Learning Docs

If `docs/learning` already exists:
- preserve useful structure and terminology unless it blocks clarity
- refactor weak hierarchy when needed so navigation becomes clearer
- merge redundant pages
- add missing index pages or cross-links
- add or tighten the onboarding-only / not-source-of-truth note if it is missing or vague
- keep filenames stable unless renaming materially improves the table-of-contents effect

## Non-Goals

Do not:
- write long-form tutorials or exercises
- mirror every implementation detail in the repo
- present learning docs as normative project policy or the decision record
- create architecture docs outside `docs/learning` unless the user asked for that too
- turn this into a code review or rewrite plan
- speculate about intent when the code does not support it

## Response Expectations

When doing the work:
- create or update files directly under `docs/learning`
- when a suitable repo-level documentation surface already exists, update it too if needed so the onboarding-only role of `docs/learning` is explicit
- briefly explain the chosen hierarchy before or after the edits
- call out any important gaps where code structure was too unclear to document confidently
