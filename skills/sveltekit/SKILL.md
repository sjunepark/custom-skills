description: Build, review, refactor, and debug modern SvelteKit apps using current routing, load/action, SSR, hydration, navigation, and state-management patterns. Use whenever a task involves SvelteKit routes, `+page/+layout/+server`, `load`, form actions, hooks, cookies, auth, invalidation, SSR or hydration behavior, or URL/server/client state boundaries, even if the user only asks for a bugfix or small feature.

# SvelteKit

Work from current SvelteKit idioms. Optimize for route and data flows that stay correct under SSR, hydration, navigation, and progressive enhancement.

Do not spend time explaining basic framework syntax unless the user asks. Focus on boundaries, best practices, gotchas, and the shortest correct implementation.

## Scope

Use this skill when the hard part is app-level or route-level behavior.

- Reach for this skill for `load`, actions, `+server.*`, hooks, cookies, auth, SSR or hydration behavior, invalidation, route state, and server/client boundaries.
- If the task is mostly about component internals, runes, snippets, local state, or styling, use the `svelte` skill.

## Workflow

1. Establish the local style before changing code.
- Inspect `package.json`, `svelte.config.*`, the route tree, hooks, and nearby route files.
- Prefer the repo's existing conventions in touched files unless the task is an explicit migration.
- For new code, default to current SvelteKit APIs and typed route files.

2. Choose the server/client boundary before writing code.
- Put server-only work in `+page.server.*`, `+layout.server.*`, `+server.*`, hooks, or `$lib/server/*`.
- Put reusable view logic in components or `$lib`, not route files.
- Keep route flow obvious: params/url/cookies/locals -> load/action -> typed props -> component.

3. Solve data flow before UI details.
- Decide where truth should live: URL, server data, component state, snapshots, context, or a shared reactive object.
- Prefer deriving state over synchronizing copies.
- Be explicit about whether data should rerun automatically or only after targeted invalidation.

4. Be explicit about navigation and SSR behavior.
- Check whether code runs on the server, in the browser, or both.
- Check whether state should survive reloads, deep links, back/forward, or only the current render.
- Check whether the route component is reused across navigation and whether anything should reset explicitly.

## Route and Load Rules

- Use `+page.server.*` or `+layout.server.*` when code needs secrets, direct database access, cookies, or trusted request context.
- Use universal `load` only when the logic is safe on both server and client and rerunning in the browser is acceptable.
- Keep `load` side-effect free. Fetch, read, and derive there; mutate in actions, endpoints, or other server handlers.
- Use the `fetch` provided by SvelteKit inside `load` so cookies, auth, SSR inlining, and internal request shortcuts work correctly.
- Prefer returning typed, already-shaped data from `load` instead of pushing reshaping work into every consumer.
- Minimize serialized data. Anything returned from server `load` becomes part of the SSR payload and may be visible to the client.
- Use generated `$types` helpers like `PageProps`, `LayoutProps`, and route-specific load/action types.
- Use `page.data` when parent layouts need child data, but do not create hidden coupling casually.
- Use `parent()` deliberately. Call other independent async work first to avoid accidental waterfalls.
- Use `depends()` and targeted invalidation when automatic reruns are insufficient. Do not scatter `invalidateAll()` as a default refresh strategy.
- Do not store request-specific data in shared modules. Mutable module state can leak across users on the server.

## Actions, Forms, and Endpoints

- Prefer form actions for user-driven mutations that naturally come from a page form.
- Keep actions close to the route that owns the UI and validation unless multiple routes truly share the mutation.
- Return validation errors with `fail(...)` rather than throwing generic errors for expected bad input.
- Use `method="GET"` plus URL params for idempotent filter and search forms.
- Use `use:enhance` for progressive enhancement, not to replace the native form flow with a custom client-side mutation system.
- Reach for `applyAction` or custom enhance callbacks only when the default enhanced flow is insufficient.
- Use `+server.*` endpoints for API-style interactions, webhooks, non-form clients, or cases where the action model is awkward.
- After setting or deleting auth cookies in an action, update `event.locals` as well when later `load` logic depends on it. `handle` runs before the action and does not rerun before the post-action `load`.
- When a cookie should be site-wide, set an explicit `path: '/'`.

## Auth and Request Boundaries

- Prefer hooks for broad auth gates that should run before protected loads.
- Prefer route-specific checks in `+page.server.*` for page-specific protection.
- Be careful with auth checks in `+layout.server.*`: child pages only reliably benefit when they call `await parent()` before protected work.
- Keep secrets, trusted headers, and raw cookies on the server side.
- Do not read auth state in client code when the server can decide once and return the result as page data.

## State Placement

- Put SSR-relevant or shareable state in the URL when it should survive reloads, deep links, and server rendering.
- Keep disposable UI state in the component if losing it on reload is fine.
- Use snapshots when ephemeral UI state should survive history navigation without becoming URL or server state.
- If state is shared only within one rendered subtree, prefer context over module-level singletons.
- Remember that route components are often preserved across navigation. If a value should reset on route change, key the subtree or derive it from `page.url` instead of assuming a remount.

## SSR and Hydration Gotchas

- Guard browser-only APIs such as `window`, `document`, storage, observers, and media APIs behind `onMount` or a browser check.
- Hydration mismatches usually come from non-deterministic rendering: browser-only branches during SSR, time or randomness during render, locale differences, or data that changes between SSR and hydration.
- Prefer stable SSR markup that upgrades in the browser over branching into incompatible markup.
- Critical interactions should still work before hydration when possible. Prefer real links and forms for important user actions, or render clear disabled/loading affordances for JS-only controls.
- Universal `load` runs on the server for SSR and then again in the browser for hydration. Do not put server-only assumptions there.
- Large or over-broad server `load` returns can bloat HTML, slow hydration, and expose data you never render. Shape the data to what the route actually needs.

## Navigation and Invalidation

- Use links and forms in ways that let the router help you. Avoid imperative navigation when `href` or a native form already expresses the flow.
- Use `goto` only when navigation is genuinely imperative.
- Invalidate the narrowest dependency you can after mutations.
- Do not use `invalidateAll()` as a reflex when one dependency or URL key would do.
- Remember that rerunning a `load` updates props but does not recreate the component. Use `afterNavigate`, derived state, or `{#key ...}` when reset semantics matter.

## Performance and Review Heuristics

- Watch for oversized layout loads that fetch data unrelated to most children.
- Watch for route-level waterfalls caused by avoidable sequential `await`s or unnecessary `await parent()` ordering.
- Watch for over-fetching in server `load` that inflates SSR payloads with data the page never renders.
- Watch for hidden auth or cookie bugs caused by putting trusted logic in universal `load` or client code.
- Watch for over-centralized state that makes route behavior harder to reason about than URL or page data would.

## Debugging Checklist

- If data is stale, check which `load` owns it, what dependencies it tracks, whether `depends()` or invalidation is missing, and whether the code is universal or server-only.
- If state unexpectedly persists across navigation, remember that layouts and pages may be reused. Key the subtree or derive from route state.
- If state unexpectedly resets, verify whether it belongs in component state, URL params, snapshots, or server data.
- If a form behaves differently with and without JavaScript, compare native action behavior against custom `use:enhance` logic.
- If auth behaves inconsistently, verify that protected reads happen on the server and that `event.locals` is updated after cookie writes.
- If cookies appear inconsistent across routes, verify `path`, domain expectations, and whether the code is running in an action, endpoint, or server load.
- If hydration feels slow or flaky, inspect SSR payload size and look for data returned from `load` that the page does not actually use.

## Migration and Compatibility

- For older code, prefer local consistency plus small targeted improvements over mixing too many old and new patterns in one file.
- Use current names and helpers on compatible versions, such as `$app/state` over older store-based access and `PageProps`/`LayoutProps` where available.
- Keep version-sensitive features behind compatibility checks. Some features depend on specific Svelte or SvelteKit versions or config options.
